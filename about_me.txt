Hi, my name is Anandita Virk. 
I am a level IV Automation Engineering Technology student at McMaster University interested in the automation technology industry.
In my last co-op I was a quality control assistant through which I learned a lot about organization and attention to detail.
Through my education I have also developed research and communication skills by working with teams and have over 100+ hours of lab experience.

By the virtue of my degree being multidisciplinary in the subject areas of automation, chemical engineering and business studies. 
I've had the great opportunity to apply my newly aquired knowledge in the form of various group projects.
